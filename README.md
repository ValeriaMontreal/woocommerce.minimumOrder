# woocommerce.minimumOrder
 Minimum order quantity check for products in WooCommerce cart.

In this project, the minimum order is 15 boxes of the same item. 
By default woocommerce offers the option "minimum order", but this option has a collective method, e.g. 15 boxes of different items, but this option is not suitable for us, so see the code.
